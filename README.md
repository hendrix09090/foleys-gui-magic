# foleys-gui-magic
Mac os standalone foleys gui magic app and default juce foleys gui magic project
i made this for people to use and play with, the standalone app lest you do everything the same as in a project more for playing and fiddling with the gui.
alo made a default juce project that is set up with foleys gui magic as the default gui for anyone to use cause i had trouble getting it to work this is also
tested on juce version 8.0.6 and latest mac os.
Note please add the missing juce libary and the foleys gui magic in the juce modules.
